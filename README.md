# Plant Disease Detection and Fertilizer Suggestion

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection and Fertilizer Suggestion repository! This project is designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts by providing an automated system to detect plant diseases from images and offer fertilizer suggestions tailored to the plant's health and nutritional needs.

## Overview

This project leverages advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to analyze plant images, detect potential diseases, and recommend appropriate fertilizers. The system aims to improve crop health and yield by offering timely advice based on visual data analysis. The repository includes code for:
- Preprocessing plant images.
- Training disease detection models.
- Implementing fertilizer suggestion logic based on disease diagnosis.
- Evaluating the performance of the detection and recommendation models.

## Features

- **Image Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean, resize, and enhance plant images for optimal analysis.
- **Disease Detection Models**: Implementation of machine learning and deep learning models to identify plant diseases from images.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation**: A recommendation engine that suggests fertilizers based on the detected disease and plant condition.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Methods to assess the accuracy and performance of both the detection and recommendation systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Utilizes frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch and scikit-learn for building and training models.
- **Image Processing**: Employs libraries such as OpenCV and PIL for handling and processing plant images.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Data Visualization**: Tools such as Matplotlib for visualizing results and performance metrics.
